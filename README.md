# Google Cluster Data Analysis with Apache Spark

## Overview

This project analyzes the **Google Cluster Trace dataset** using **Apache Spark (PySpark)** in order to study machine behavior, task scheduling, resource usage, and fault tolerance in a large-scale production cluster.

The analyses answer a predefined set of questions provided as part of a university lab assignment and include **two additional original analyses** that explore scheduling behavior after task evictions.

The project focuses on:
- Distributed data processing with Spark
- Event-based analysis of large datasets
- Resource management and scheduling behavior in production clusters
- Reproducible and structured analytical workflows
